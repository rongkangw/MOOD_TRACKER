Things to do:

- create a statistics screen with stats on mood

- entries for other months are in database but no reflected when changing month on Homescreen.
    likely val currentM by remember { mutableStateOf(currentMonth) }
    viewModel.getMonthRecords(months.indexOf(currentM)) code not re-running everytime currentmonth changes. FIX
