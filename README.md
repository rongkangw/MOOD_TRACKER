Mini Personal Project delving into Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

This is a simple personal mood tracker utilising:
- Room API for database management
  
- Compose Navigation for pagination
  
- Compose ViewModel for persistent data storage and manipulation between screens
  
- Vico for displaying mood trends through line charts

Possible future features may include:
- Addition of inputting text into daily records alongside moods
- More diverse charting of mood trends
- More convenient user experience utilising swiping

Not being developed at the moment but may come back to it in the future :)
